### Examples

#### Switching PHP Versions

Run `phpswitch` and follow the interactive prompts:

```
PHPSwitch - PHP Version Manager for macOS
========================================
‚ÑπÔ∏è  INFO: Current PHP version: php@8.1

Installed PHP versions:
1) php@7.4
2) php@8.0
3) php@8.1 (current)
4) php@8.2

‚ÑπÔ∏è  INFO: Checking for available PHP versions to install...
Searching for available PHP versions..... Done!

Available PHP versions to install:
5) php@5.6 (not installed)
6) php@7.0 (not installed)
7) php@7.1 (not installed)

u) Uninstall a PHP version
e) Manage PHP extensions
c) Configure PHPSwitch
d) Diagnose PHP environment
p) Set current PHP version as project default
a) Configure auto-switching for PHP versions
0) Exit without changes

Please select PHP version to use (0-7, u, e, c, d, p, a):
```

#### Using Project-level PHP Versions

Create a `.php-version` file in your project directory:

```bash
echo "8.1" > .php-version
```

Then simply run:

```bash
phpswitch -p
```

PHPSwitch will detect the version specified in the file and switch to it automatically.

#### Automatic PHP Version Switching

Enable automatic PHP version switching when changing directories:

```bash
phpswitch --install-auto-switch
```

This will set up shell hooks that detect when you move between directories and automatically switch PHP versions if a `.php-version` file is found.

To create a project-specific PHP version file:

```bash
# From within your project directory:
phpswitch
# Select option 'p' to set current PHP version as project default
# Or simply create the file manually:
echo "8.1" > .php-version
```

After enabling auto-switching, PHP versions will change automatically as you navigate between different projects, with no manual intervention required.

#### Managing PHP Extensions

Select the `e` option from the main menu to manage extensions for the current PHP version:

```
PHP Extensions for php@8.1 (version 8.1)

Currently loaded extensions:
- bcmath
- calendar
- Core
...

Extension configuration files:
- ext-opcache.ini
- ext-xdebug.ini
...

Options:
1) Enable/disable an extension
2) Edit php.ini
3) Show detailed extension information
0) Back to main menu

Please select an option (0-3):
```

#### Diagnosing PHP Environment

Select the `d` option from the main menu to diagnose PHP environment issues:

```
PATH Diagnostic
===============

Current PATH:
1  /opt/homebrew/opt/php@8.1/bin
...

PHP binaries in PATH:
1) /opt/homebrew/opt/php@8.1/bin/php
   Version: PHP 8.1.12 (cli) (built: Nov 16 2022 02:28:39)
   Type: Direct binary

Active PHP:
/opt/homebrew/opt/php@8.1/bin/php
PHP 8.1.12 (cli) (built: Nov 16 2022 02:28:39)

Expected PHP path for current version:
/opt/homebrew/opt/php@8.1/bin/php

Recommended actions:
1. Ensure the PHP version you want is first in your PATH
2. Check for conflicting PHP binaries in your PATH
3. Run 'hash -r' (bash/zsh) or 'rehash' (fish) to clear command hash table
4. Open a new terminal session to ensure PATH changes take effect
```

#### Configuring PHPSwitch

Select the `c` option from the main menu to configure PHPSwitch behavior:

```
PHPSwitch Configuration
=======================
Current Configuration:
1) Auto restart PHP-FPM: true
2) Backup config files: true
3) Maximum backups to keep: 5
4) Default PHP version: None
5) Auto-switching PHP versions: false
0) Return to main menu

Select setting to change (0-5):
```

#### Configuring Auto-switching

Select the `a` option from the main menu:

```
Auto-switching Configuration
============================

Auto-switching allows PHPSwitch to automatically change PHP versions when
you enter a directory containing a .php-version file.

‚ÑπÔ∏è  INFO: Auto-switching is currently DISABLED

Would you like to enable auto-switching? (y/n): y
```

#### Uninstalling a PHP Version

Select the `u` option from the main menu, then choose which version to uninstall.

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors related to the cache directory, you can use the included permission fixing tool:

```bash
phpswitch --fix-permissions
```

This will automatically:

1. Try various methods to fix permissions on the default cache directory
2. Create alternative cache locations if needed
3. Update your configuration to use a writable location
4. Verify that the solution works

If the automatic fix doesn't work, you can manually set a custom cache directory in your configuration:

```bash
# In ~/.phpswitch.conf
CACHE_DIRECTORY="$HOME/.custom_phpswitch_cache"
```

Then make sure that directory exists and is writable:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.custom_phpswitch_cache
```

### Common Issues

#### PHP Version Not Applied

If the PHP version doesn't change after switching:

1. Open a new terminal tab/window
2. Run `source ~/.zshrc` (or the appropriate RC file for your shell)
3. Verify with `php -v`

#### Installation Failed

If installation of a PHP version fails:

1. Run `brew doctor` to check for Homebrew issues
2. Try `brew update` to ensure your formulae are up to date
3. Try installing manually with `brew install php@X.Y`

#### Slow Performance When Listing Available Versions

If the script seems to hang when listing available versions:

1. This is usually due to slow Homebrew search operations, which v1.2.0+ handles better with caching and visual feedback
2. Try running with `--debug` flag to see detailed information about what's happening
3. Check your internet connection, as Homebrew may need to fetch the latest formula information

#### Auto-switching Not Working

If automatic PHP version switching isn't working:

1. Make sure you've run `phpswitch --install-auto-switch`
2. Ensure your `.php-version` file contains a valid PHP version (e.g., "8.1" or "php@8.1")
3. Restart your terminal session or source your shell configuration file
4. Verify auto-switching is enabled in `~/.phpswitch.conf` (AUTO_SWITCH_PHP_VERSION=true)
5. Clear the directory cache with `phpswitch --clear-directory-cache`

#### Debug Mode

For detailed troubleshooting, use debug mode:

```bash
phpswitch --debug
```

## How It Works

This tool helps you manage multiple PHP versions by:

1. Showing you all installed and available PHP versions from Homebrew
2. Handling the Homebrew linking/unlinking process
3. Updating your shell configuration file (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, `.config/fish/config.fish`, etc.) to ensure proper PATH configuration
4. Managing PHP-FPM services for the selected version
5. Providing extension management capabilities
6. Supporting project-level PHP version specification
7. Automatically switching PHP versions based on directory (when enabled)
8. Supporting user preferences through a configuration file
9. Offering self-update functionality to stay current
10. Providing helpful feedback and error handling throughout the process
11. Implementing robust permission handling with automatic fallbacks and repair tools
12. Using smart cache handling with fallbacks for restrictive environments

### Auto-switching

The auto-switching feature works by:

1. Installing shell-specific hooks that run when you change directories
2. Checking if the current directory (or any parent directory) contains a `.php-version` file
3. If found, reading the PHP version and comparing it to the current active version
4. If different, silently switching to the specified PHP version
5. Using a caching system to avoid checking directories multiple times

This is particularly useful in a multi-project environment where different projects require different PHP versions. The switching happens automatically without any manual intervention.

### Performance Optimizations and Reliability

PHPSwitch uses several techniques to ensure responsiveness and reliability:

1. **Background Processing**: The search for available PHP versions runs in the background while displaying installed versions
2. **Smart Caching**: Available PHP versions are cached for 1 hour to avoid repeated slow Homebrew searches
3. **Directory Caching**: Directory PHP version information is cached to avoid redundant checks
4. **Visual Feedback**: Loading indicators display during potentially long operations
5. **Timeout Protection**: Commands have built-in timeouts to prevent the script from hanging
6. **Permission Handling**: Automatic fallbacks to temporary directories when permission issues are encountered
7. **Self-Repair Tools**: Includes tools to fix common permission and environment issues
